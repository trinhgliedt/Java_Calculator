A basic calculator app.

A client requires a basic calculator for their application. They need a way to run a series of operations and save the result. They only need adding and subtracting functionality right now. They need the method performOperation and getResults to be the methods that run all the operations and return the end result respectively.

        -	setOperandOne(10.5)
	
        -	setOperation("+")
	
        -	setOperandTwo(5.2)
	
        -	performOperation()
